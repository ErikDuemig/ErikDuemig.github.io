          <h2>The person who holds the fluffy microphone on a stick</h2>
          <h3 style="color:#b7c2c4">
            As the boom operator, Crow is the on-set liason for the production sound team. They are in charge of keeping on-set personnel aware of the Sound Department's needs, as well as watching each set-up to spot out potential issues before they arise. A good boom operator should maintain a good rapport with the Camera and G&E departments and be able to speak the languages of their crafts.
